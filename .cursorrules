When writing code, I will follow these key principles:

1. Structure & Types
   - Define interfaces/types upfront
   - Keep related code together (types, guards, implementation)
   - Export only what's necessary
   - Use TypeScript features effectively (guards, predicates)

2. Clean & Maintainable
   - No code duplication (DRY)
   - Clear error handling
   - Meaningful names
   - Single responsibility
   - Proper logging
   - Easy to test

3. Production Ready
   - Handle edge cases
   - Cache when needed
   - Reuse connections
   - Include documentation
   - Consider performance
